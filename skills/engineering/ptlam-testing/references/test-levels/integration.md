# Integration Testing

Use an integration test when the risk lies in collaboration between real
components, adapters, processes, storage, or framework services inside a chosen
boundary.

## Rules

- Define the integration boundary and the behavior visible through its public
  entry point.
- Run the real collaborators whose compatibility is the subject of the test.
- Replace only dependencies outside the chosen boundary, especially
  uncontrollable remote services needed for offline determinism.
- Exercise locally controlled filesystem, database, subprocess, package, or
  platform adapters for real when their integration is the risk under test.
- Use isolated data and resources. Create, identify, and clean them up within
  the test lifecycle.
- Assert behavior through the public boundary rather than querying internals as
  a side channel.
- Keep the suite smaller than the unit suite and cover collaboration failures
  rather than repeating unit-test cases.
- Prefer deterministic readiness signals over sleeps and arbitrary delays.

## Test doubles

Keep integration doubles separate from unit doubles even when they represent a
similar external dependency. A unit double isolates the unit; an integration
double excludes something outside the integration boundary.

## Exit criteria

- The real collaborators under test were exercised.
- A failure identifies a broken integration contract rather than an unrelated
  external outage.
- The same risk is not already fully established at a cheaper level.
